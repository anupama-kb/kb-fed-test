## Description of my solution

It's started with selecting the right layout for the exercise and I choose flex box for the solution. Next step was to fetch the data and decided to display image, name, city, coutry and email as core fields from the API. Then i added few design features like linear-gradient so that it looks good.


## Things I would do next

I could have added more info pane upon clicking on each of the card.

## Assumptions that I made

Clicking "See More" to add 1 card in view.
Core field Assumption - Image, Name , City, Country, Email.
Assumed layout to be flexbox.
